## 1. Implementing a New Model ASE Calculator

**Implementation Concept:**

- Refer to the `CHGNetCalculator` class. Other models' calculators also need to inherit from `ase.calculators.Calculator` and implement the `calculate` method.
- The `calculate` method is responsible for extracting structural information from the input `Atoms` object, invoking the model prediction, and updating the calculation results.

```python
from ase.calculators.calculator import Calculator
from ase import units

class YourModelCalculator(Calculator):
    """YourModel ASE Calculator for MD simulations."""

    implemented_properties = ("energy", "forces", "stress")

    def __init__(self, model, device='cpu', **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.model = model
        self.device = device
        print(f"YourModel will run on {self.device}")

    def calculate(self, atoms=None, properties=None, system_changes=None):
        """Calculate properties using YourModel."""
        super().calculate(atoms, properties, system_changes)

        # Extract structural information from Atoms object and calculate with the model
        energy = self.model.get_energy(atoms, device=self.device)
        forces = self.model.get_forces(atoms, device=self.device)
        stress = self.model.get_stress(atoms, device=self.device)

        # Update calculation results
        self.results.update(
            energy=energy,
            forces=forces,
            stress=stress,
        )
    ...
```

## 2. Using the Standard ASE MD Engine

**Corresponding Additions:**

- In the CHGNet MD code, different MD engines (e.g., NVE, NVT, NPT) are selected based on the ensemble. You can directly refer to the implementation logic of the `MolecularDynamics` class.

```python
from ase.md.langevin import Langevin
from ase.md.nptberendsen import NPTBerendsen

# Set the calculator
calculator = YourModelCalculator(model, device='cpu')
atoms.set_calculator(calculator)

# Choose the MD engine
if ensemble == "nvt":
    dyn = Langevin(
        atoms=atoms,
        timestep=timestep * units.fs,
        temperature_K=temperature,
        friction=0.01,
        trajectory='nvt.traj',
        logfile='nvt.log',
        loginterval=10
    )
elif ensemble == "npt":
    dyn = NPTBerendsen(
        ...
    )
    ...
```

## 3. Initializing and Running MD

**Corresponding Additions:**

- Refer to the implementation of `MolecularDynamics.run()`. Observers (e.g., trajectory recorders) can be added before running MD.
- Ensure that the `Atoms` object is correctly bound to the `Calculator` during initialization.

```python
# load md and calcu
from your_model_module import YourModelMolecularDynamics, YourModelCalculator

# Load the model
model = YourModel()

# Set the ASE Calculator
calculator = YourModelCalculator(model, device='cpu')
atoms.set_calculator(calculator)

# Initialize and run MD
dyn.run(steps=steps)
```

## 4. Additional Notes

### Key Points

1. **Calculator Implementation:** The `calculate` method should compute energy, forces, and stress based on the new model.
2. **MD Engine:** Select appropriate ASE MD modules based on the ensemble (e.g., `Langevin` or `NPTBerendsen`).
3. **Data Analysis:** Use ASE's built-in trajectory recording and analysis functionalities.

### Mapping to the Official Code

- **CHGNetCalculator:** Analogously implement `YourModelCalculator`, completing result computation and updates in the `calculate` method.
- **MolecularDynamics:** Refer to the logic for selecting MD engines and pressure control.
- **TrajectoryObserver:** Use as a reference for implementing trajectory recording functionality.
